# Search-Engine-Prism

Title of the Project: Search Engine

## Problem Definition:

Develop a Search Engine to help the user search the web. The web creates new challenges for
information retrieval. The amount of information on the web is growing rapidly, as well as the
number of new users inexperienced in the art of web research. The Search Engine should make
use of the structure present in hypertext and should be able to index specific web pages on the
web.

## Methodology:

The model adopted for the development of “SEARCH ENGINE” is Waterfall model with Prototyping. 
The basic reason for using this model is that this model adds prototyping as a sub
process. Instead of freezing the requirements before a design or coding can proceed, a prototype
is built to understand the requirements. This prototype is developed based on the currently
known requirements. The prototypes are usually not complete systems and many of the details
are not built in the prototype. The goal is to provide a system with overall functionality

## Tools:

-JDK for implementation of indexer &amp; other functions
-A database server for storage of crawled web pages &amp; indexes.(MySQL/Apache)
-An IDE.(Netbeans)
